				I learned the importance of prioritizing school. 
			</div>
			<div class="timeline__event__description">
<p>Back when I was in fourth grade and below, I used to neglect my assignments because I preferred playing outside. However, as I entered the fifth grade, something changed within me. I realized that to achieve my dream of becoming a soldier, I needed to prioritize my education. School became my top priority, and I started dedicating more time to my studies. I rarely play outside and diligently complete all my assignments and activities. This shift in focus has not only improved my academic performance but also brought me one step closer to achieving my dream of serving as a soldier in the future.</p>			</div>

				I've Gained Skills
			</div>
			<div class="timeline__event__description">
<p>At this age, I've already gained some impressive skills in computers and fixing electrical things. I owe my knowledge to YouTube, where I've learned how to repair computers, speaker amplifiers, and even remote-controlled toys. It's incredible how watching videos online has allowed me to pick up these skills. Because of this newfound passion for tinkering with electronics, I've decided to change my dream from becoming a soldier to pursuing a career in engineering. As I look ahead, I'm eager to continue honing my skills and knowledge in the community of computers and electrical engineering, working towards a future where I can contribute to the ever-evolving technology. It's surprising how interests can change and lead us down different paths in life.</p>			</div>

				I had my own beliefs about religion
			</div>
			<div class="timeline__event__description">
<p>At 12 years old, I started forming my beliefs about religion. I've become agnostic because I have many questions swirling in my mind about my faith. One of the big questions is that there are so many religions worldwide, and each group insists that their God is the only true one. These got me thinking about the validity of these claims. Plus, I've also noticed hypocrisy among some people in my religion. This has made me question whether they truly practice what they preach. Despite these doubts, I haven't told my parents about my evolving beliefs. I continue to attend church because I fear their reaction if I were to reveal my agnostic stance. For now, I'm quietly navigating my spiritual journey, hoping to find answers that resonate with me.</p>			</div>

				I made real friends
			</div>
			<div class="timeline__event__description">
<p>When I was in 7th grade, I went through a tough time dealing with bullies who tormented me almost every day. I felt completely isolated, with no friends to support me against these bullies. I was too weak to stand up to them physically or emotionally. However, things have changed since I entered eighth grade. I'm grateful to have found true friends among my schoolmates, who also happened to be my classmates in the sixth grade. It's a comforting feeling to have them around. Even though they used to play pranks on me that sometimes hurt, I didn't let it bother me because I believed in the sincerity of our friendship. These experiences have taught me the value of genuine friendship and how it can make a world of difference in our lives. I now feel stronger and more confident with my friends by my side as I navigate the challenges of middle school. This journey has shown me the importance of resilience and the power of true friendship.</p>			</div>

				I learned how to deal with daydreaming
			</div>
			<div class="timeline__event__description">
<p>As I've grown older, I've noticed a growing sense of restlessness and distraction within me. While I don't want to self-diagnose, it feels like I might be experiencing maladaptive daydreaming, which often distracts me and makes it hard to focus on my studies. To cope with this challenge, I've turned to playing computer games as a way to distract myself. It helps me temporarily shift my focus and find moments of relief from the constant daydreaming. While it may not be a perfect solution, it's my way of managing this distraction and trying to stay on track with my responsibilities.</p>			</div>

				I had insecurities and fear of being judged by other people
			</div>
			<div class="timeline__event__description">
<p>At 15, I found myself fighting with insecurities and bouts of jealousy. I often feel insecure about my physical appearance, thinking I have a thin body, less-than-ideal genetics, and what I perceive as an unattractive face. These thoughts can be overwhelming at times. Jealousy creeps in when I see other teenagers who seem to have it all â€“ a seemingly better life, talents to showcase, and confidence to share their world on social media. I wonder if I have anything special to offer; I'm unsure if I possess any unique talents. Fear of judgment holds me back from sharing my thoughts or making posts on my social accounts. It's a challenge I'm trying to overcome, slowly building my self-esteem and finding ways to embrace my individuality. While these feelings can be tough, I remind myself that I'm not alone in experiencing them, and there's room for growth and self-acceptance.</p>			</div>

				 I fell in love
			</div>
			<div class="timeline__event__description">
<p>I've been fighting with intense feelings for a girl I met online two years ago. She has become a constant presence in my day-to-day thoughts and daydreams. While I'm not sure if this is love, it feels more like an obsession. I find myself endlessly scrolling through her social media accounts, though I'm too shy to initiate contact or confess my feelings. It's a rollercoaster of emotions; I often feel down when she doesn't post updates on her socials. These unrequited feelings can be overwhelming, leaving me in a state of longing. It's a challenge to navigate these emotions and muster the courage to express myself. At this stage, I'm learning to balance these intense feelings while understanding that life offers many more experiences and connections.</p>			</div>

				I became more confident and independent.
			</div>
			<div class="timeline__event__description">
<p>At this age, I've been working on building my confidence and caring less about what others say or think about me. However, one thing that hasn't changed is my intense daydreaming. It's become a real distraction from my studies, even though I managed to graduate with honors. Interestingly, I've found that I enjoy being alone, and it brings me a sense of relaxation. I don't quite understand why, but solitude seems to work for me. I've also realized that I don't need others to help me deal with my mental struggles; I can manage on my own. It's a part of me I'm still trying to understand and work through as I navigate the complexities of being a teenager.</p>			</div>

				I became more mature and overthinker.
			</div>
			<div class="timeline__event__description">
<p>As an 18-year-old, I've come a long way in building my self-esteem. I've also developed a sense of emotional resilience, finding that I don't easily lose my temper when faced with provocations, and I'm much better at controlling my emotions overall. Additionally, my newfound maturity has led me to become more open-minded, particularly in the realm of philosophy. I've started contemplating life's deeper questions with great curiosity. Yet, there's something that plagues my mindâ€”I tend to overthink, especially about my existence and what the future holds for me. It's a common concern at this age, not knowing exactly where life will lead. I've adopted a 'it is what it is' attitude, accepting that uncertainty is a part of life. As I move forward, I'll keep a watchful eye on how things unfold. I hope that with each passing year, my perspective on life will continue to evolve and change for the better.</p>			</div>
